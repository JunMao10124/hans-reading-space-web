        <p><strong>What I Loved:</strong> 
          I love this book because the story is very big and creative. 
          It talks about space, time, and the future of humans. 
          Some parts were scary but also exciting, like the space war and the universe ending. 
          I learned to think more about how small we are in the universe. 
          This book made me love science fiction even more.</p>
        <p><strong><em>Who I would recommend it to:</em></strong> 
          Anybody who is a sci-fi fan. 
          You definitely won't disappoint after reading this book.
          I recommend reading all three books (This is a sequel to The Three Body Problem and Dark Forest).</p>

              <h4>Essential Questions</h4>
              <p>
                  <strong>What does literature have to teach us about the human experience, the world, and our place in it?</strong>
                  <br>The Dark Forest shows that the universe is dangerous and full of unknowns.
                  It teaches us that humans must be strong, smart, and united to survive.
                  Even when the world feels small, we still try to protect what we love. This is part of being human.<br><br>
                  <strong>What makes a great story? What makes a great storyteller?</strong><br>
                  A great story makes you feel something, teaches you something, and stays in your mind after you finish it.
                  The Dark Forest is a great story because it mixes science, danger, and deep thinking.
                  The “Dark Forest Theory” is not just a cool idea. It changes how I think about the universe.
                  The writer, Liu Cixin, is a great storyteller because he connects big science ideas with human emotion.
                  He makes you care about the characters and also wonder about space and the future.
                  A great storyteller doesn’t just write well. They make you see the world in a new way.

          <h4>The Dark Forest</h4>
          <p class="review-author">By Liu Cixin</p>

          <h5>Brief Summary:</h5>
          <p>
              The Dark Forest is the second book in The Three-Body Problem series.
              Earth is facing a secret alien invasion from the Trisolarans, and the UN
              launches a global project called the “Wallfacer Plan”—a strategy that gives
              four individuals the power to carry out plans without explanation. The book
              explores cosmic fear, survival, trust, and the future of humanity.
          </p>

          <h5>Choice Text:</h5>
          <p>
              The assembly remained silent as all waited for the announcement of the final Wallfacer.
              The first three, Tyler, Rey Diaz, and Hines, represented balance and compromise among
              the political powers of the United States, Europe, and the Third World, so there was
              considerable interest in the final selection. As he watched Say turn back to the paper
              in the folder, world-famous names flashed through Luo Ji’s mind. The final Wallfacer would
              be one of them. He looked ahead four rows and surveyed the backs of the first-row occupants.
              That’s where the first three Wallfacers had been before they ascended the rostrum, but from
              behind he couldn’t make out whether any of the people he had in mind were seated there.
              Still, the Fourth Wallfacer would definitely be there.
          </p>
          <p>
              Say slowly raised her right hand, and he watched as it pointed to a spot not in the first row.
              She was pointing at him.
              <br />
              <strong>“The Fourth Wallfacer: Luo Ji.”</strong>
          </p>

          <h5>Why I Chose This Text:</h5>
          <p>
              This is one of the most important moments in The Dark Forest. It shows how an ordinary person,
              Luo Ji, is suddenly chosen to carry a huge responsibility for the future of Earth. This scene
              is full of suspense and meaning. It made me think about leadership, fate, and what it means to be
              trusted with power. I chose this as my Choice Text because it shows how a single moment can change everything.

              <h4>Big Fish Film Reflection</h4>
              <p>
                  <strong>Q</strong>: What is the role of storytelling in the relationship between Edward and his son?<br>
                  <strong>A</strong>:
                  Edward tells stories to connect with his son, Will.
                  At first, Will thinks the stories are fake and doesn’t believe them.
                  But later, he understands that the stories show Edward’s heart, dreams, and love.
                  Even if they are not true, they help Will understand his father and bring them closer together.<br><br>
                  <strong>Theme Statement:</strong><br>
                  Big Fish teaches us that stories are more than just facts. They are a way to understand people, remember them,
                  and keep their spirit alive. Imagination can be a powerful part of truth.
